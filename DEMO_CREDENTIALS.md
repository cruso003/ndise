## Architecture Notes

### Platform Separation

**`ndise-web` (Current Application)** = Government Officers & Partners ONLY
- ✅ NSA Operations Center
- ✅ Executive Dashboard
- ✅ Border Control
- ✅ Enrollment
- ✅ Police Portal
- ✅ Agency/Partner Services

**Separate Applications (Not in this demo):**
- `ndise-citizen-mobile` - React Native app for 4.5M citizens
- `ndise-citizen-portal` - Optional web portal for citizens
- Citizens do NOT use `ndise-web` - they get separate consumer apps

### AI Integration

All dashboards are powered by AI intelligence layer:
- **8 AI Capabilities:** Duplicate detection, pattern recognition, relationship mapping, predictive analytics, anomaly detection, smart consolidation, natural language queries, risk scoring
- **Real-time Intelligence:** Continuous monitoring and alerts
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** AI recommends, humans decide
- **Explainable AI:** Confidence scores and reasoning shown

### Agency Integration

15+ agencies monitored in real-time:
- Civil Registry (NIR), Immigration, Police (LIPS), Tax Authority, NEC, LTA, DVA, Health Ministry, and more
- Real-time status: Online/Degraded/Offline
- Performance metrics: Response time, success rate, uptime
- Data sync tracking: Today/Week/Month volumes

---

## Notes

- All users can access the Executive Dashboard (system overview)
- Navigation is dynamically filtered based on user permissions
- Attempting to access unauthorized pages redirects to "Access Denied"
- Sessions are stored in browser localStorage for demo purposes
- In production, this would use secure HTTP-only cookies and JWT tokens
- Permission system allows for fine-grained access control beyond simple roles
- NSA Operations Center is the PRIMARY dashboard reflecting national security focus
- AI intelligence flows from NSA → Executive → Operational dashboards
